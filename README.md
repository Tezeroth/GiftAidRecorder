- idea - user authentication, another page listing users
- store object data to an googledocs API
- get some animation on the front page, nice sounds etc

An idea I had to help encourage the data input accuracy of till operators

nts: edit the js so it saves the previous date and clicks the amount and saves it as a JSON.
find out out to export to print (pdf?) when u get time
